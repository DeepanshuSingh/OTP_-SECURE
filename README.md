# OTP_-SECURE


THIS PROJECT GIVES IDEA AND APPROACH TO SECURING OTP AND PROTECT USER EVEN IF HIS CREDENTIALS ARE COMPROMISED.

MAJOR POINTS INCLUDE:
1..WE USED FLASK AND IT'S MODULE
2..IT INCLUDES TWO WORKING FILES 
  a)APPLICATION.PY  WHICH STIMULATES BACKEND WORKING
  b)CLIENT.PY WHICH STIMULATES FRONTEND APP WORKING
  
  
The app on frontend changes the otp recieved while sending server for authentication. The app has certain properties depending
upon the mobile it is in i.e. mobile's MAC address, IP Address, System version etc.. can be includes . The app changes otp as per
its properties. And thus ensures it is the guenuine user who has requested the transaction.
